        RATL is a MERN Stack application that is geared toward the simplification of job searches. With its easy to navigate UI, users are able to search for jobs in any given area, archive a posting of a job, post job connections (if applicable), and set reminders on their calendars so that no important events go unattended. I took initiative in creating the Calendar feature in the application. Being relatively new to component life cycles, I struggled quite extensively. I ran into issues re-rendering a users reminder when inputted on a specific date. The way that I solved this issue was by sending that data to MongoDB and utilizing a ComponentDidMount method to retrieve that data each time the screen refreshes. I definitley had a fun time creating this tool for this application for it forced me to read into documentation, ask my team mates for help, and practice my problem solving skills.

        Guardian is a Full Stack application intended for secretarial use. It allows the user to take in an animal, mark it ready for adoption, and it will display all the animals available for adoption. This application utilizes a NoSQL database that allows a user to adopt one animal. My role for this application was to construct a clean and functional backend. Creating the tables was no challenge for me but what was a bit challenging was creating references so that a user can adopt an animal. I mistakenly created the reference In the user table when it should've been created in the animal table. Thankfully I caught my error long before deployment so that we could provide a functioning full stack application.

        NotStarbucks, an application built for any user who enjoys visiting non-chain coffee shops. By using Google's GeoLocation API, a user is asked to input an area code of their choosing, or simply turn on their location and 10 different coffee shops that aren't StarBucks related will appear. Creating a polished UI was important in the development of this application. By applying my CSS, HTML, and JavaScript skills I was able to create an aesthetically pleasing app that suits the intended purpose of the application.

        We are living in troubled times where a vast amount of familes are being affected by this pandemic. I thought it would only be suitable to create an application that would inform the general public. This React based application is built on a global scale and also allows the user to select a country that will then result in displaying the amount of people who have been Infected, those who have recovered, and those who have passed away. The toughest part about this application was seeing how severe this situation is. It is definitley eye opening and it isn't easy to see the numbers of those who have lost their lives. Ultimately, I'm happy to have informed the general public of this situation by providing them with real time data.
